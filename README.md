# Welcome to my GitHub

 Hello! I'm Prateek, a graduate student in Computer Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology. With a solid foundation in both software development and electronics from my undergraduate studies, I've been privileged to work with companies like Amdocs India Pvt. Limited and Infosys Limited. My experiences range from developing core product enhancements for telecommunication clients to spearheading development and delivery of functional user interfaces for B2C websites.

I'm passionate about software design, and I've sharpened my skills in various languages and tools like Java (Spring-Boot), React JS, Python, HTML, CSS, JS, and more. I'm also familiar with database management, having worked with SQL/PL-SQL, and am adept with DevOps tools like Git and Jenkins.

Outside of the tech realm, I've had the opportunity to volunteer in India, conducting computer and robotics workshops for underprivileged kids. I believe in continuous learning and have completed certifications in Modern React with Redux, Java Web Services with Spring Boot, and Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.
